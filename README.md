Run on Azure: https://notebooks.azure.com/trackdr/libraries/trackdr-Geospatial-Notebooks

Binder usually is overtasked
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/trackdr/Geospatial-Jupyter-Notebooks)

Better idea than Binder is to launch a paid for instance using
http://www.jeremydjacksonphd.com/docker-for-aws/

Make new notebook

!git clone https://github.com/TrackDR/Geospatial-Jupyter-Notebooks

Open notebook out of cloned directory
